#Write up an explanation on the design of the class diagram
The class diagram shows a person class with only attributes "first name" and "last name", and a method "Print full name".
The parent and student classes both inherit from the person class, with the parent class having occupation and boolean methods.
The student class, however, have a homeroom and unique student ID attributes, and they can be enrolled in subjects.
